# Claude Code Integration

This directory contains my personal dotfiles configuration, with a focus on optimizing workflows for using coding agents and general AI agents effectively from the command line.

## Purpose

Claude is helping me set up and configure this environment to:

- Streamline interactions with AI coding agents from the terminal
- Create efficient workflows for common development tasks
- Integrate AI agent capabilities with existing command-line tools
- Document best practices and patterns for agent-assisted development

## Work in Progress

This is an active project where configurations and documentation are being developed and refined over time.
